# Portfolio
The goal for this homework was to create your first portfolio with the following aspects:
  1. When the links in the nav bar are clicked, the user interface scrolls to that section
  2. When click on the links in section about the work, the user interface scrolls to the title images of developed app (<strong>I was not able to get this part</strong>)
  3. The first project application image should be bigger than the others.
  4. When the image of the first app is clicked the app is deployed
  5. When the page is resized the layout is responsive

The first thing I did was create a header, navigation bar, and sections. I gave all of them colors so I could visually track any changes.

I then used flex properties to get the items in the sections to wrap and push the title of the sections to the left.

When adding the Projects images I gave the first image a bigger width and height.I gave it an href attribute to link my first project (my portfolio!) I also gave all images alt attributes with image descriptions. 

I then added media queries to have the page respond when it's made bigger or smaller. I also added different colors to visually check where those marks were. 

I then used gave each section an anchor id. I put those ids in a href to link in the nav bar so when clicked, the page jumps to that section.
